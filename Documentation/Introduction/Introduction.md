# MoneyContour App

## Introduction
This app is personal, it solves the problem I have with finance. I know how to set my financial goals when I am broke, but the minute the money comes in I go bezerk.
This app is about helping the user properly make financial goals in a fun way and in a way that helps them track their expenditure to better optimize those financial goals.
Many of us are stuck in our ways of making money but we are not good at managing it to the last cent when it comes in, at least i know i am.

## Solution
A piece of technology in our cellphones that allows us to enter, track and manage financial goals. The solution is to create an app which will help the user set clear financial goals and better track their finances.

## App dsecription
The app will be able to store basic information of the user to create a visually pleasing profile and use their information such as date of birth to suggest proper spending methods according to their age. This goes further as to optimise spending goals according to the users gender.

Not only will the allow the user to login using their credentials, but The app will also be able to secure user information at the users dicretion such as saving login credentials and allowing fast login.

The user can create multiple wallets under their profile. These wallets are used as a collective concept of the users money generating or spending repository. Each Wallet can host mutliple budgets. The idea of a Wallet is to maintain one solid entity for similar transactions, or transitions from the same source. The user can transfer money from one wallet to another.

The user can use the app to create whole budget and record their transactions. The use can create multiple "wallets" which will consist of mutliple budgets,The user can set goals for each budget and for each wallet. These goals will be configured by the user and used to track that periods expenditure and income that the user records.

The budget offers stats of the users money usage and provides these stats in the form of metrics. Analytics will also be available for Wallets. The budgets will hold
multiple "entries/transactions/financial goals". These entries record the incomings and out comings of money into the wallet, align with the particular budget their are created in or linked to.

An entry can belong to multiple budgets. This provides flexibility by allowing the user to link entry into multiple budget plans. This also allows the app to not repeat calculations for a common money expenditure.
